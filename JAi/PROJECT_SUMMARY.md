# JAi Project Summary

## Overview

JAi is a cross-platform Progressive Web App (PWA) for private journaling with AI-powered insights. The application allows users to capture daily thoughts, track moods, organize entries with tags, and receive AI-generated summaries and reflections on their journal entries. The entire system is designed with privacy as a core principle, ensuring that all data remains secure and under the user's control.

## Key Features

1. **Private Journaling**: A clean, distraction-free interface for writing journal entries
2. **Mood Tracking**: Record your emotional state with each entry
3. **Tagging System**: Organize entries with custom tags
4. **AI Summaries**: Get AI-generated insights and reflections on your journal entries
5. **Advanced Search**: Find past entries by keywords, mood, tags, or date
6. **Cross-Platform Access**: Use on any device through the Progressive Web App
7. **Full Privacy**: Self-hosted backend and LLM with encrypted data storage

## Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend is built as a Progressive Web App using Next.js and React, providing a responsive and app-like experience across all devices. Key components include:

- **Next.js Framework**: For server-side rendering and static site generation
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and customizable styling
- **Zustand**: For state management
- **PWA Configuration**: For offline capabilities and installability
- **Responsive Design**: For optimal viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop

The frontend communicates with the backend through a RESTful API and handles authentication, data fetching, and user interactions.

### Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express, providing a secure API for the frontend to interact with. Key components include:

- **Express Server**: For handling HTTP requests
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user authentication
- **Supabase Integration**: For database operations and storage
- **Ollama Integration**: For running the local LLM
- **API Endpoints**: For journal entries, authentication, and AI summarization

### Database

Supabase is used as the database solution, providing:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: For storing journal entries, user data, and metadata
- **Row-Level Security**: For ensuring data privacy
- **Real-time Capabilities**: For instant updates
- **Authentication Services**: For user management

### AI Engine

The AI capabilities are powered by Ollama, running lightweight LLMs such as TinyLlama or Phi-3-mini:

- **Self-hosted LLM**: For complete privacy and control
- **Summarization API**: For generating insights from journal entries
- **Contextual Understanding**: For providing relevant reflections
- **No External API Dependencies**: For eliminating privacy concerns

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for easy deployment:

- **Backend**: Deployed on a cloud VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean)
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel or Netlify
- **LLM**: Running on the same VPS as the backend
- **HTTPS**: Secured with Nginx and Let's Encrypt
- **Firewall**: Configured to restrict access to necessary ports

## Privacy and Security Measures

Privacy is a core principle of JAi, implemented through:

- **Self-hosted Infrastructure**: No third-party services for core functionality
- **Encrypted Data**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **No Data Sharing**: No integration with external analytics or tracking
- **User Control**: All data remains under the user's control

## Development Workflow

The project follows a structured development workflow:

1. **Backend Development**: Setting up the server, database, and API endpoints
2. **Frontend Development**: Creating the user interface and integrating with the API
3. **AI Integration**: Implementing the LLM for generating insights
4. **Testing**: Ensuring functionality, security, and performance
5. **Deployment**: Setting up the production environment

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. **Enhanced Analytics**: More detailed insights into journaling patterns
2. **Customizable Themes**: User-selectable visual themes
3. **Export/Import**: Data portability options
4. **Multi-user Support**: Optional expansion to support multiple users
5. **Offline Mode**: Enhanced offline capabilities
6. **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text for journal entries
7. **Media Attachments**: Support for images and other media

## Conclusion

JAi represents a modern approach to journaling, combining the therapeutic benefits of writing with the insights of AI, all while maintaining strict privacy standards. The application demonstrates how advanced technologies can be leveraged to create personal tools that respect user privacy and provide genuine value.
